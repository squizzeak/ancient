# OvrEdit for Renegade BBS
Did you run a Renegade BBS?  Did you edit the overlay file to customize your strings?  This was software I wrote over 23 years ago to do just that.  I was 15, so give me a break on the tone, language, grammar, etc. in the docs.

Of course it was shareware.  I was 15 and had to go to the mall somehow!  It was quickly cracked for obvious reasons, so I only sold two licenses.

No, I don't support it any longer.  I have no idea if it would even compile (last time I did so I was running QB4.5 under MS-DOS 6).  I'm just dropping it here for posterity :)
