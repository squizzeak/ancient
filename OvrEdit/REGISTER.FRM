                         Registering OvrEdit v10-05.3a
               Written by Todd Hendricks (aka Electric Visionary)

Okay.  You want my program.  I want your money.  It works out pretty good.
So, for the LOW, LOW, INCREDIBLY STUPID, EXTREMELY LOW price of 15 dollars,
I will send you a super-duper awesome keycode that will magically unlock
all of the CRIPPLED (dare I say it, but CRIPPLED) features in OvrEdit.

The features that will be unlocked are: (ta-da)

* The ability to edit ALL strings in the ovredit.dat file (instead of just
  the first 42).
* The ability to save/import custom configurations into future versions of RG.
* It's only a one time fee!  This keycode should (and probably will) work on
  all future versions of OvrEdit.  While the price may increase, you will
  still get new versions for free (you lucky bastard you.)  Registering NOW
  will save you money in the long run!

'Wow Todd!  That's SUPERRIFFIC!!  What do I do?' you say?  Well it's real
simple, anyone with half a brain cell can understand it.

FIRST:  Sign the Line below promising me your first born child.

        _______________________________________________________
             (No, you don't really have to do this, dummy)

SECOND:  Go make out a check or money order for 15$ (US FUNDS ONLY)
         to Todd Hendricks.  (You DO have to do this, however.)

on another computer.  I understand that any violation of the rules

FIFTH:  Sign the X line.  (You know, by the X?)
        YOU MUST SIGN!!  Not signing voids all transactions (and worse yet)
        and I will charge a 5 dollar service fee for returning your money.

SIXTH:  Cut on the lines (what did you think the little 8< things meant??)
        fold it up, and put it in an envelope along with the bread, and
        send it to:

Thanks for your support.  I look forward to ripping you off again some time.
