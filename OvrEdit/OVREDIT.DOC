-------------------------------- *DISCLAIMER* --------------------------------

Yes this is necessary, because this program has the potential of screwing
your rg .ovr file VERY seriously.  It is of course not INTENDED to do this,
if used correctly it is a very valuable tool.

I take no responsibilty whatsoever for whatever may happen because of this
program, be it your renegade setup screwing up, your hard drive crashing,
your computer blowing up, your house catching on fire, or a giant, man eating
tarantula invading the US and eating the inhabitants.

You are granted the right to distribute this program, given that you do not
modify any of the original distribution files.  You are granted the right
to modify the data files, with the SOLE purpose being for your use, and not
to re-distribute.  Authenticity verification IS performed on the .ZIP, so if
you find that any files do not have a little -AV next to it, please call the
DS BBS (708)653-0376, and in your new user application please state you would
like the most recent version of OvrEdit.

--------------------- 1.0  GENERAL PROGRAM INFORMATION -----------------------

Well, one day about 5 months ago, I was home sick from school with a 100
degree fever.  I got REAL damn bored REAL damn fast.  So I sat down and
started writing this utility.  About 7 hours later the first version was
released.  (In actuality it was about 3 days, but it was 7 hours worth
of work).

To use, simply extract the archive into your main renegade directory.  Next,
copy the file you wish to use (INDIVID.DAT or DUPED.DAT) to OVREDIT.DAT.
Then type 'OVREDIT' at the command prompt and watch the fireworks.


--- 1.1  System Requirements
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are the system requirements for version 10-05.3 of OvrEdit:

* 2 megabytes of Extended Memory
* HIMEM.SYS loaded through CONFIG.SYS
* DOS 3.0 or greater
* Renegade v10-05 Bulletin Board System


--- 1.2  Features
         ~~~~~~~~

Here are some of the features that OvrEdit sports (yes, I said sports):
(Registered version has some extras, but also includes these defaults.)

==> Full color translation of pipe codes in bottom windows (I don't do
    ^P codes because I can't read the SCHEME.DAT file.  Cott doesn't
    release Quick Basic file formats.)
==> A really cool interface.
==> Uhh.. I guess that's it.

It may not seem like alot, but it DOES do alot.  I can't exactly say that
80+ line lengths is a feature.  It's a given.  Plus most of the good shit
requires registration.

--- 1.3  Registration
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~

See register.frm for more info on registering.

Yes folks, you knew it would happen eventually.  I am now requiring
a small registration fee of 15 dollars for my work.  What you get when
you register:

==> Ability to edit virtually all the strings in RENEGADE.OVR.
    (The only un-editable strings are those that are elusive and contain
    low-ascii codes.  Alot of these type were dropped from the .DAT file
    due to 'beeps'.  I may add support for this in a later version.  Also,
    I did not include sensitive commands, such as menu codes, or things like
    the command-prompt (psuedo-dos) commands in the DOS emulator.)
==> Ability to save current configuration for import into later .OVR's.
==> The knowledge that what you have paid for is SAFE.  The registration
    codes are based on an algorythim calculated from your machine ID, so
    that even if someone DOES see your registration code and manage to
    memorize it (all 21 characters) he/she won't be able to do much with it.

Sorry that I had to do this folks, but I had done all this work and nothing
to show for it.  When you register you will receive a registration keycode
that will enable all features.

When the program is unregistered, the program will only read the first 42
lines of the OVREDIT.DAT file (that's three pages).  You can re-arrange the
.DAT file any way you want, but it's either shift it 42 lines each time you
want to change something different, or pay 15 dollars and have the ability
to edit them all at the same time.

I know what you're saying.. and I don't believe in crippleware either.  But
it's the only way.  We are all getting pretty cheap nowadays, so if I didn't
do something like this, no one would register.


--- 1.4  Version 3 is here at last!
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well folks, you've been waiting for this version.  The version where the
author has everything he wanted done, done.  The version where you can
edit any string.  The version where there are 80+ line lengths.  The version
that can be used with any version of RG.  The version where I earn money.  :)

Even though I said that I was NOT going to do a major update of the program
until the next version of RG came out, I changed my mind, because it's been
almost 9 months so far since Cott released a new version.

In this version, I also added a function to change all duplicated strings in
the .OVR file at the same time.  This shouldn't be a problem to most of you,
because of the fact that in fully-configurable things such as Obv/2 and the
like, you aren't given a string twice.

You may notice that this version requires XMS memory to function;  That is
because of the immense number of strings.  If I were to do Random Access
files, it would be too slow.  Besides, if you don't have XMS memory, you
aren't doing so well as far as computers go, so I wouldn't want to take your
money in that case.

Due to the fact that I WAS using XMS memory, a little bug appeared that you
could not pad any string with spaces because of the way that it stores strings
in XMS memory.  Well i fixed that by adding an indicator to store the length
of the string, rather than trimming the spaces off the end of it.  Rather
easy to do, actually.


------------------------- 2.0  USAGE OF THE PROGRAM --------------------------

Usage is pretty straight forward, use the arrow keys to scroll thru strings,
press enter to edit, and escape/F10 quit.  See the quick key reference at the
top of this document.  It can also be viewed by pressing F1 in the program.

New keys added:

Home      :  Top line on page
End       :  End line on page
Ctrl-Home :  Top line/Top page
Ctrl-End  :  End line/End page
Alt-G     :  Goto Line #


--- 2.1  Description Amenities
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Amenity #1 - <> brackets.

Things contained in greater-than/less-than signs will be put in automatically
ie 'Tried=<wrongpw>'  Means you have to specifiy the string for 'tried=' but
the wrong pw is automatically added.

There is also the 'literal' <> brackets identification, which instead of a
variable, it will include quotation marks.. ie  'Pick which: [1-<#"]">'
this will display the words 'Pick which: [1-<#>]' Where the '#' is the
variable.  It's just another descriptor to help make identification easier.


Amenity #2 - (...) ellipses

A description with ellipses (...) after means it is continued on the next line.
A description with ellipses (...) before means it started on the pervious line.
ie 'Tried=<wrongpw> ...'
   '... Actual=<actualpw>'

   which would display like this:

   'Invalid Password!  Tried=<wrongpw> Actual=<actualpw>'

The reason this is done like this is because (apparently) Pascal stores
strings as individual items, and plugs in the actual variable at run time.


Amenity #3 - (s) Parenthesis 'S's

If you encounter this, it means an 'S' will automatically be added after the
string if the value of the variable it is displaying is > 1.


Amenity #4 - 'D' Duplicate Strings

When manuevering through the strings, you may, on occasion (depending
on which version of OVREDIT.DAT you picked up) encounter a blue "D" next
to strings.  This means that the string you are editing is duplicated, and
when you save this string, the strings in the same location everywhere else
will be changed at the same time as well.  This will not happen if you
have gotten the individual OVREDIT.DAT which lets you edit the duplicated
strings individually.  But it is up to you to find out which does what.


--- 2.1  Editing Strings
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When editing, you can restore the default value (the value in the original
RENEGADE.OVR) By pressing F5.  Escape discards changes, and enter accepts
changes.  There is a listing at the top of this document.

If you type just a key, it will erase the entire string.  Pressing INSERT
or backspace will cancel this and allow you to add on to the string.

Pressing CTRL-Y erases the entire string and starts you from scratch.

A major limitation of this is that there can be no more characters in the
changed string than there were in the original .OVR.  The editor will not
let you enter more than the original amount.


-------------------------- 3.0  DATA FILE FORMATS ----------------------------


--- 3.1  OVREDIT.DAT
         ~~~~~~~~~~~

The first line is the version that this OVREDIT.DAT was created for.
Please don't change this.  It causes nasty results.

(This format has changed as of v10-05.3)
Here is the format for the rest of the file (without quotes)

"IEMSI Negotiation     000653033Attempting IEMSI negotiation ... "
 \____________________/\____/\_/\_______________________________/
            1            2    3                4

1.  Description (22 chars, padded w/ spaces)
2.  Offset in RENEGADE.OVR (decimal, 6 chars)
3.  Maximum length of string (decimal, 3 chars, max 120)
4.  Default string (# of chars defined in 3, max length 120)

Note that 3 also defines the length of 4.  That's because when Cott put the
strings in there initially, he only put in enough length for the string he
defined:  no more, no less.

An addition as of 10-05.3 is that duplicate strings are recorded.  There
is an identifier to the program that the string contained above itself is
duplicated, and where.  Here is the format of such an identifier.

"dupe004509008503009867..."
 \__/\_________________..."
   1           2

1.  The word 'dupe'.  It's used to identify the duplicate nature of the
    string right above it.
2.  Locations.  (Decimal, 6 chars).  Can go on for 180 characters.

Note:  ALL strings are in there now, so there is really no need for this.
       * - All strings can only be edited if the program is registered.
       If it is not, only the first 42 are edited (3 pages worth.)

--- 3.2  OVREDIT.SAV
         ~~~~~~~~~~

* - This is a registered only feature

This file may be used to distribute your configuration to other people, and
also can be used to save your configuration for importing into future versions
of renegade.  NOTE:  When importing, if the string imported is longer than
the maximum length allowed, it will be truncated.

If you _DO_ decide to distribute your configs, make sure that you distribute
your copy of OVREDIT.DAT along with it.  The lines in OVREDIT.SAV are
synchronized with the entries in OVREDIT.DAT.

First Line:  CRC #            - Used to help the program determine whether
                                it is safe to import.  DO NOT CHANGE THIS
                                LINE.  I will not be responsible for
                                anything that may happen as a result of
                                changing this.  This number is gotten by
                                basically calculating the CRC of the
                                OVREDIT.DAT file.  If the .SAV file
                                is not being imported by the same .DAT
                                file it was created with, it won't import.
                                I know you guys aren't stupid, but I like
                                to make it so that as little bad can happen
                                as possible.
Following Lines:  Strings     - Stored in the order they are defined in
                                OVREDIT.DAT.


-------------------- A.0  THE AUTHOR'S PERSONAL BITCH AREA -------------------

Welp, I had noticed that my little comments were scattered throughout the
docs, so I decided to condense them into one nice little section.

If you people find something wrong with this program, that's fine, but you
have to understand that there are BOUND to be problems (duplicate strings,
unknowns, etc) due to the nature of this program.  I mean, what we are doing
here was NOT meant to be done.  We are hacking the internal structure of a
person's code.  I have talked to Cott, and he is okay with this, as long
as no one touches his copyright information.  The .OVR files are CODE, they
are not strictly storage for string space.  The only reason that this works
at all is because Pascal stores it's strings in the .OVR files the same way
that they do in the normal files (length leading, string following.)

I want you guys to know what a HUGE investment of time this was for me.
Programming it, writing the docs, working out the semantics of registration,
and all the like is a big pain in the ass.  But it was worth it.  I like to
program, and I'm not exactly allergic to money you know.  I have done my
absolute best to test the program and make sure it's bug free, and also to
come up with a fair price for registration.


------------------------- B.0  CONTACTING THE AUTHOR -------------------------

Well, if you've gotten this far, I can tell you are interested in the program.
To contact me, you can either call my BBS, or email me.

BBS Number - (708)653-0376
Internet Email - <redacted>@mcs.com <not available until end of august, 1995>

Seeing as how this is a MAJOR release, I've got a little problem regarding
internet e-mail.  I WILL have an account shortly, but I'm not exactly sure
that the account will be under that name (I'm not paying for it, good ol'
pop is, so he decides).  If you check the alt.bbs.renegade.* forums, I will
do my best to post the latest info in the appropriate forums, as well as my
e-mail address in case you want to get in touch with me.  Also, anyone who
is really good with internet shit (I'm definately not) and would like to help
me create alt.bbs.renegade.ovredit (which would be exceptionally rad), please
contact me.

If you have any comments, suggestions, ideas, bug reports, or general "you
suck's", please don't hesitate to contact me.  You can also contact me by
phone, but that is only given out privately.  Contact me by one of the above
measures and I will give it out upon request.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE contact me if you have ANY suggestions, no matter how
stupid they may sound.  I am always looking for an excuse to code something.
Plus there is no point in having this program if it doesn't do what you want
it to do.


--- B.1  Getting the Source Code
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sorry, the source code is no longer for sale (guess you guys missed out).


------------------- C.0  GREETS, THANKS, AND "I HATE YOU'S" ------------------

Special greets to my good buddy Usul.  And to Hurricane, wherever he went to.
And also to Lars Ulrich, a good friend who has also disappeared.

Goddamit.  I keep forgetting who I want to greet.  This is the whole point
of writing documentation.  All programmers look forward to this.  "Ahh
finally.  The greets.  The whole reason for coding at all."  Hello to all
my friends, you know who you are.

Last minute greet: Dominion.  Good luck w/ Atrius: Journey.  (Can I help? :)
